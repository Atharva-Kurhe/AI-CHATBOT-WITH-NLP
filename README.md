# AI-CHATBOT-WITH-NLP

*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*: ATHARVA MANOJ KURHE

*INTERN ID*: CT08PEM

*DOMAIN*: PYTHON PROGRAMMING

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTHOSH

* *Description of the Task* :  This project involves building a simple Python-based chatbot that can interact with users through a series of predefined patterns. The chatbot can respond to various types of queries such as greetings, jokes, date & time, and general information about programming languages and AI. The main objective is to create an interactive and user-friendly chatbot that can simulate basic conversations and answer frequently asked questions.

* *Features* : Responds to greetings like "Hi," "Hello," etc.
,Provides current date and time.
,Tells jokes and fun facts.
,Answers common questions related to Python and Artificial Intelligence.
,Handles basic coding-related queries.
,Provides fallback responses for unrecognized inputs.
,Offers a clean exit functionality.

* *Tools and Libraries Used* : 

1]Python 3.x: The programming language used to write the chatbot logic.

2]NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):
nltk.chat.util was used to create a pattern-based conversational system.
NLTK helps with processing and understanding user inputs through predefined patterns and reflections.

3]datetime: Used to fetch the current time and date.

* *Editors Used* :
This code can run in Visual Studio Code (VS Code),PyCharm,Jupyter Notebook,IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) or any other python supporting environment. I have used IDLE, default editor that comes with Python installations with features like Simple UI for beginners with basic debugging and code execution capabilities.

* *Where This Task is Applicable* : 
This chatbot can be used in:

1]Customer Support Automation: It can be adapted for customer service to answer frequently asked questions and handle basic queries.

2]Education: The chatbot can be used as a learning tool for students learning programming languages, offering coding-related advice and assistance.

3]Personal Assistant: It can be integrated into personal assistant applications for simple information retrieval tasks like checking the time or telling jokes.

4]Prototyping Chatbots: The code can serve as a base for more advanced chatbot systems that use machine learning models or NLP techniques to understand and respond to user queries more accurately.
